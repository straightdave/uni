* To learn PHP/Slim
* To accumulate experiences on such related sphere

## Derived outputs

## Status
this is in the progress and any help is much welcomed

## how to install this
1. git clone to your local
2. restore mysql file : db.sql to database 'uni_dev' or other you like
3. set up apache site (this is a slim site: point doc root to /this/app/folder/public); you should notice that here using a .htaccess file in public folder to make url rewrite (refer to slim doc)
4. config your mysql db info in public/index.php
